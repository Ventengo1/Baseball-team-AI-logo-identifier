I created an ai on google teachable machine learning platfrom to detect which baseball teams logo it sees and associate them with thier respective team.

Here is the like to see it: https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/fH3YmNE2f/
To use it upload a picture of a mlb teams logo or show to logo from another device using your webcam.

I have also added files at the bottom for the final code. It is in 3 different files. The rest of the files are screenshots of my work.
